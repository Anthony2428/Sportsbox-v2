# SportsBox v2
> Create React Express App

## Boilerplate

This setup allows for a Node/Express/React app which can be easily deployed to Heroku.

The front-end React app will auto-reload as it's updated via webpack dev server, and the backend Express app will auto-reload independently with nodemon.

## Application

1. Navigate to this directory and install both front and backend dependencies with `npm i`.
2. After installation is complete, run `npm start`.
3. In your browser, go to <http://localhost:3000> and the app should now be running.  

## Deployment

Once changes are committed, deploy to **Heroku** by running `git push heroku main`.
